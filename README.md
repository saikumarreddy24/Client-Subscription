# Client-Subscription
**Details about the Project**
1. Given the dataset which includes clients data, by using that data, a model should be designed to predict client subscription to the term deposit.
2. To design the model, a popular machine learing algorithm called Decision Tree algorithm is used.
3. Then split the dataset into two parts i.e., 1)train.csv 2)test.csv
4. train.csv is the dataset which is used to train the model
5. test.csv is the dataset which is used to test the model
